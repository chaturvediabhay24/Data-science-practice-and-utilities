1) The folder contains two notebook one for 
   post-training-quantization
   and other for quantization-aware-training.
2) There are two folders containing tflite 
   models, one for each type of quantization.
3) post-training-quantization techniques 
   works fine as a result we can see there 
   is difference in size of original and 
   quantized model.
4) But there no significant decrease in size
   of quantization-aware-training model. I 
   will look into that...
